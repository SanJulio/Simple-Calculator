# Simple Calculator (Python)

This is a basic command-line calculator written in Python.

The program allows the user to choose an operation (add, subtract, multiply, or divide), enter two numbers, and see the result.  
The calculator runs in a loop until the user chooses to quit.

## How it works
- The user selects an operation from a menu
- The user enters two numbers
- The program performs the chosen calculation
- The result is displayed
- The program repeats until the user exits
